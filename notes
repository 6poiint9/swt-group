Time management:

Currently:

 - Decentralized via an Exel document

 -> local machine, no backup, 

 - every Employee enters information and after each month passed to Supervisor

 - checks and hands over to HR

 -> flex time account updated

 vacation:
 - employee fills a request document (with start and end date) -> sent to supervisor
 - Supervisor accepts and sends to HR or rejects the request
 - 30 vacation days per year but can be taken over to next year
 - no work time captured
 flex-time: 
 - can add up and be used for a whole day or some hours
 sickness:
 - inform the HR directly (HR informs the supervisor)
 -> no work time captured
 Breaks:
 - 30 or 45 min.
 
 - every employee has a Laptop protected by login and use credential


 
NEw:

 - Centralized and captures: work time, vacation, sickness ...

 sickness:
 - registered in system by HR and supervisor gets an email notification
 
 - vacation request should be covered

 - employee could delete a vacation request or an approved request

 - at end of the month employee registers all work times and transmit time 
 sheet to superisor
 - after sending times cannot be changed any more
 - supervisor can accept and reject (with reasoning) the work -> if rejected
 employee can request again

 => employee can see own statistics: flex-time, vacations
 - can flips through months and access work time details

 => supervisor can see as well (his own and of his employees)
 
 => HR for everyone and everything
 -> and see if they work too much  (more than 10h/day)
